There is a couple of things that I changed from my original idea. I originally wanted to touch themes of escapism. Player was going to live regular life as always and escape that life through their dreams. What changed is that the narrator kind of controls the story, so even if the player lives a normal life like in the original, but instead of dreams, it is the narrator that puts him in spontaneous situations. Also, I did include the narrator even though I said I wouldn't have one.
